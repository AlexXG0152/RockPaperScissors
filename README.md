# RockPaperScissors
Simple and lightweight rock paper scissors game (without long if-elif-else loop) in just 45 lines of code.


I've often seen advice for novice developers to write a game of rock, paper, scissors. 
In all examples I've seen infinite if-elif-else loops. 
I’m sure it’s necessary to understand how such loops work, but the program doesn’t come out short and easy.


So I decided to write a short version with just one such loop.

The result is in front of you.
